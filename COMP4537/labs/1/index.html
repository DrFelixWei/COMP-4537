Part 2 Questions
1. Open the writer.html and reader.html in two different tabs of same browser. Would the reader.html have access to the content stored in the local storage by the writer.html?
Yes, reader.html can access the content stored in localStorage by writer.html because localStorage is shared across all tabs of the same origin.

2.Open the writer.html and reader.html in two different tabs of two different browsers ( e.g. one in chrome, one in Firefox) . Would the reader.html have access to the content stored in the local storage by the writer.html?
No, reader.html cannot access the content stored in localStorage by writer.html when opened in different browsers because localStorage is browser-specific.
